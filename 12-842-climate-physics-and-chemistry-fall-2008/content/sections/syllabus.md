Course Description
------------------

This course introduces students to climate studies, including beginnings of the solar system, time scales, and climate in human history. It also talks about:

*   methods for detecting climate change, including proxies, ice cores, instrumental records, and time series analysis
*   physical and chemical processes in climate, including primordial atmosphere, ozone chemistry, carbon and oxygen cycles, and heat and water budgets
*   internal feedback mechanisms, including ice, aerosols, water vapor, clouds, and ocean circulation
*   climate forcing, including orbital variations, volcanism, plate tectonics, and solar variability
*   climate models and mechanisms of variability, including energy balance, coupled models, and global ocean and atmosphere models

This course meets with graduate subject 12.842 (Climate Physics and Chemistry), but assignments differ.

Homework and Project
--------------------

There are 4 homework assignments and each student will be asked to do a term project. Reporting on the term projects will take place at the end of the term in both written (no more than 10 pages) and oral presentation (about 20 minutes). Oral presentation is optional for undergraduate students.
